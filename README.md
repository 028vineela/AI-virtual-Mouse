# AI-virtual-Mouse
Hand Gesture Recognition in python using OpenCV and Mediapipe and implementation of virtual mouse using hand gestures.
This project aims to create an AI-based virtual mouse using hand gestures. The virtual mouse allows users to control the computer cursor by simply moving their hands in front of a webcam. It utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to recognize hand gestures and map them to corresponding mouse operations.
