# AI-virtual-Mouse
Hand Gesture Recognition in python using OpenCV and Mediapipe and implementation of virtual mouse using hand gestures.
This project aims to create an AI-based virtual mouse using hand gestures. The virtual mouse allows users to control the computer cursor by simply moving their hands in front of a webcam. It utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to recognize hand gestures and map them to corresponding mouse operations.
Features
Control the computer cursor using hand gestures
Implement basic mouse operations like left-click and right-click
User-friendly and intuitive interface
Real-time hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe frameworks
Cross-platform compatibility
